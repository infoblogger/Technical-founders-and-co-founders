<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Many times we find the information of the company, and we observe various acronyms such as;&nbsp;</span><em><span>CEO</span></em><span>&nbsp;, CFO and CIO.</span><br /><span>In other cases, someone is described as &ldquo;&nbsp;</span><em><span>CEO</span></em><span>&nbsp;or founder&rdquo; of the business organization, as if they were the same thing and there was no difference between the two positions.&nbsp;The different acronyms, and the quality of founder, is not just a matter of words, but what we do as an important part of the firm.&nbsp;In this post we address the differences of the main senior positions of a company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>When we talk about founder, CEO, CFO, CIO, and other acronyms, we refer to the main senior positions of a company.&nbsp;FounderThis figure exists almost always since the company takes life, and it is nothing more than a title that indicates who was the author of the idea at the time of&nbsp;</span><span>creating the company</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span>Do all founders serve as CEOs?</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Alfonso Zum&aacute;rraga, founder and CEO of Wanna Chef.com and a specialist in this field, has remarked in recent interviews about the dichotomy between CEO Director or founder, although both &ldquo;are terms commonly confused today.&nbsp;Both are equal and many times both roles fall on the same figure, but it is not always like that or it should be like that&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;The founder is the visionary, he is the one who observes the market and finds the opportunity.&nbsp;The founder has the vocation of an inventor and therefore his spirit wants to change the status quo and evolve the society in which he lives.&nbsp;The CEO has a managerial and executive soul.&nbsp;For him the idea can often be the least of it.&nbsp;His motivation lies in transforming the idea into a business reality&rdquo;.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span>CEO (Chief Executive Officer)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>CEO or Executive Director, the CEO is the head of the management and&nbsp;</span><span>administrative direction of the company</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;It could be said that the CEO Director is the pillar of the company, and as warned, I may or may not be the founder.&nbsp;The CEO connects the business with the market, has the final say on budget and investment decisions, and directs the company's strategies to achieve its goals.&nbsp;The word that most defines him would probably be &ldquo;leader&rdquo;, since he guides the team, removes obstacles and provides resources.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span>CFO (Chief Financial Officer)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Financial Director, is in charge of the economic and financial planning of the company.&nbsp;He is the one who decides the investment, financing and risk with the aim of increasing the value of the company for its owners (whether they are shareholders or partners).</span><br /><span>He brings financial and accounting knowledge and, in general, an analytical view of the business.&nbsp;In many cases he is also the strategic advisor to the CEO.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span>CIO (Chief Information Officer)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Responsible for the company's information technology systems at the process level and from the planning point of view.&nbsp;The CIO analyzes what benefits the company can derive from new technologies, identify which ones are of most interest to the company, and evaluate their performance.</span><br /><span>It focuses on improving the efficiency of internal processes in order to ensure effective communication and keep the organization running efficiently and productively.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span>CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>He is responsible for Marketing activities, which include sales management, product development, advertising, market research and customer service.&nbsp;Their main concern is to maintain a stable relationship with end customers and communicate with all other departments to get them involved in Marketing activities. Now that you know the difference between Founder, CEO, CFO, and CIO, can you define your role in the company?</span></p>
